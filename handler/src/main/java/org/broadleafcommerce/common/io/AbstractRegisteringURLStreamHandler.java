/**
 * Abstract class to allow a protocol handler to be registered with the JVM.  
 * Subclasses MUST be named 'Handler' and they MUST NOT be in a base (default) package.
 * 
 * Also, subclasses must register themselves by calling 
 * {@link AbstractRegisteringURLStreamHandler#registerHandler(Class)} in a static block.  For example:
 * 
 * static {
 *     registerHandler(Handler.class);
 * }
 * 
 * This will register the Handler class in a particular package.  There can be multiple Handler 
 * classes for multiple protocols, but each must be explicitly called "Handler" and each one must be in a different package.
 * 
 * The protocol, by convention, will be the last part (or folder) of the package in which the Handler class is located.
 * 
 * For more information, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#URL-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-int-java.lang.String- and 
 * the 'java.protocol.handler.pkgs' system property.
